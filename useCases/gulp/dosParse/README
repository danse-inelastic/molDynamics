plans: i'm combining multiphonon with kernel generator, so all this will be together soon..


What I learned:

*Gulp does not do so well on the DOS with this classical potential
*Everything is shifted to lower energies
*The Gamma point spectrum is not continuous--not a surprise!  Like a lot of 
delta functions
